            <p>Taiwan is an island in the Pacific Ocean. Today, different groups of people live on the island, including Hokkien, Hakka, Chinese from other provinces, Taiwanese aborigines and Southeast Asian immigrants. Before World War II, Taiwan was a Japanese colony.
                In 1895, due to the failure of the First Anti-Japanese War, China gave Taiwan, Liaodong Peninsula and other places to Japan. After World War II, the government of the Republic of China moved to Taiwan and started building the island. When the government of the Republic of China arrived in Taiwan in 1949,
                Nearly 2 million soldiers and their families have also moved to Taiwan. When the government of the Republic of China arrived in Taiwan at that time, there were many things that needed to be resolved. At the end of World War II in 1945, Taiwan's economic and sanitary conditions were low. The government of the Republic of China had a significant influence on the development of Taiwan,
                Transform the economic entity from agriculture to high-tech industry.
                During the 1960s and 1980s, a series of serious new policies and development plans industrialized Taiwan. Taiwan's National Bureau of Statistics said that in 1965, per capita GDP was $229, and 30 years later, in 1984, per capita GDP increased to $3,225.

                When the R.O.C. government arrived in Taiwan, the first thing they did was a series of land policies. First, they amended the bill to reduce ties to the Chinese bill system, and then issued Taiwan dollars.
                After that, they established many rules for farmers so that they could be self-sufficient. The second step in improving economic conditions is to develop "light industry". The government began to help build small factories to produce textiles, shoes and paper. This helped Taiwan prepare to move to "heavy industry".
              To stimulate investment, the government is encouraging investors from around the world to set up factories in Taiwan's ports. This time is the third step of development. The site will discuss what's happening in Taiwan, Taiwan's policies and changes and who's going to help and make all these things work.
